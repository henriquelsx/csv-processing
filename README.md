# csv-processing
Developed a scalable, asynchronous processing system for large CSV files with Node.js, RabbitMQ, and microservices. This prevents the API from being blocked by massive uploads while still providing real-time status tracking to the client. This architecture pattern is standard in enterprise systems like ERPs, CRMs, hospital software, and HR systems.
